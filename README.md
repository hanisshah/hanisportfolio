## Product Portfolio Website Template Product People

A template product portfolio for sharing great product stories. You can use this template to create, personalize, and deploy your portfolio onto the internet for FREE. 

Check out a live preview of the template portfolio [here](https://product-porfolio.vercel.app/).

This template was created in collaboration with [@nicolemors](https://github.com/nicolemors). The template was developed ontop of the [next.js blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). The structure of project pages was inspired by [Bart Krawczyk's portfolio](https://www.bartkrawczyk.com/portfolio). Creating a template for product managers was inspired by [@manuarora700](https://github.com/manuarora700) and his work on templatizing a [developer portfolio website](https://github.com/manuarora700/simple-developer-portfolio-website). 

# The structure of the portfolio

The portfolio is built to highlight you and the projects you've worked on and we've kept it dead simple for that purpose. Here are the pages included:
* **Home** Orient your reader to your portfolio with a brief introduction to yourself and links to your recently published projects. You can also include a headshot and a link to download your resume.
* **About** Tell the reader a bit more about yourself and path into product with a fun picture.
* **Projects** The projects you've worked. Each project will have its own page highlighting your role, project execution, challenges and achievements.

Find more information on creating content for your portfolio in the "Create your product manager portfolio website" [blog post]().

# Personalizing your portfolio



# Build and Deploy

To get your website up and running start by cloning the GitHub repo to your own personal GitHub account. This you can do in the GitHub UI.

Next clone the repo locally to your machine so you can make your project edits and other personalization. 

```git clone <repo>```

Once copied locally, install the project modules. 

```npm install```

You'll want to preview your changes by running a local development server. 

```npm run dev```

Once you're happy with the changes you've made push the updates to your master branch.

```
git add .
git commit -m "files updated"
git push origin
```

Next, create your Vercel hobby account. Create a new project and connect it to your personal GitHub repo. 
Vercel will automatically publish your repo to a FREE website hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (aka *.vercel.app). If you wish to host your portfolio on a bespoke URL (aka lisafeets.com), you can purchase a domain name through Vercel directly and publish your site there.
